Here are some areas where discrimination is most likely to manifest at the
Family Support Center.

## Encountering Law Enforcement

Generally, the Family Support Center is cooperative with law enforcement. However, when working with law enforcement, be mindful if officers

- Entered shelter without proper consent 
- Searched shelter without proper consent 
- Dismissed medical or childcare concerns raised during an arrest 
- Harassed or threatened witnesses, including the use of racial profiling 
- Engaged in abusive behavior related to a client's gender identity or sexual orientation, including sexual harassment or derogatory remarks 
- Used force (verbal or physical) or weapons against individuals

Important considerations before videotaping an arrest in the home or in public:

- Armed law enforcement officials are first and foremost concerned for their own safety. Before taking out a recording device, it is best to assess the situation and determine whether taking a video could escalate the situation and endanger anyone present. 
- It is extremely important that if I choose to record, I make it obvious that I am recording. Almost every state has laws against “secret” recordings. I ought not to not cover up, hide or conceal my camera/phone. 
- The right to record law enforcement usually comes with the qualification that one must not “interfere” as they are carrying out their “duties.” This means I should stand several feet away from any law enforcement action taking place if I choose to record.

### Draft of Incident Report

At the door. (Note: I try to speak with all officers *immediately outside the
shelter front door*.)

- Date:
- What time of day? 
- How many officers? 
- Names: 
- Did they have guns drawn or were they touching their weapons? 
- How did their uniforms identify them? 
- Who did they say they were and why did they say they were there? 
- Did agents speak only English, or did anyone speak to the client in their native language? 
- Did they say who they were looking for? 
- Were policy agents present at the emergency exits or windows? 
- Did they use verbal/physical force (banging hard on the door, yelling threats; touching, pushing person) to enter? How? 
- Who opened the door when they came in? 
- Was the person 16 years old or younger? If so, how old? 

Supposing law enforcement is responding to an emergency, we'd let them into shelter. (Note: If I let law enforcement into shelter, they'll generally want to stay immediately next to the entrance, rather than "exposing" themselves by coming into the common area.)

- Did the client verbally refuse consent to enter their room? They said: 
- How did law enforcement react if anyone said they denied consent to enter?
  How did shelter staff react?
- Did the client verbally refuse consent to search their person or belongings? They said: 
- How did law enforcement react if anyone said they denied consent to search?
  How did shelter staff react?
- When did law enforcement tell the clients what department they were from? 
  - from immigration?
  - accompanying child protective services?
  - before arrest, after arrest?
- Did officers yell at anyone? 
- Did officers touch or draw weapons inside the shelter?
- If so, did they identify themselves as immigration agents beforehand? 
- Did they keep anyone from moving around freely? 
- Did they enter bedrooms? Did they ask for permission first? 
- Did they look in closets or drawers? Did they ask for permission first? 
- How did officers react to the children in the building?
- Did they handcuff anyone in front of children?
- Did the client bring up concerns like the need for childcare or medical issues? They said:
- How did officers react to concerns for childcare?
- Did they take pictures of documents? If so, whose? 
- How did they get the documents? 
- Did they take fingerprints? If so, whose?

## Mandated Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect

> Government administrators justify these extraordinary protocols by invoking the need to protect vulnerable children, a compelling state interest by any account. Medicaid and welfare information systems are, in fact, intertwined with the enforcement arm of Child Protective Services (CPS). Any sign of an unsafe environment can trigger a CPS investigation, a traumatic and even more invasive affair. 

[Doriane Coleman, “Storming the Castle to Save the Children: The Ironic Costs of a Child Welfare Exception to the Fourth Amendment,” William and Mary Law Review 47, no. 94 (2005): 413–540, http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol47/iss2/3.] 

> No one doubts the need in some cases for intervention. The aggressiveness and tone of the screening, on the other hand, suggest a tendency to presume that poverty itself is a marker of risky parents  or that poor mothers are deficient mothers until proven otherwise.

[Tina Lee, Catching a Case: Inequality and Fear in New York City’s Child Welfare System (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 2016); Diane DePanfilis, “Child Neglect: A Guide for Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention,” U.S. Department for Health and Human Services Office on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2006, https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/neglect.pdf.]

> By the numbers, poor families are likelier to be investigated and likelier to be found culpable for abuse and neglect, but there is little evidence that abuse itself is more prevalent among them than in society at large. 

[Douglas J. Besharov, “Child Abuse Realities: Over-Reporting and Poverty,” Virginia Journal of Social Policy and the Law 8, no. 1 (2001): 165–205, http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/childabuse_realities_00_fall.pdf.] 

> Justice Thurgood Marshall once asked, in dissent from the case that the Ninth Circuit relied upon in Sanchez: “Would the majority sanction, in the absence of probable cause, compulsory visits to all American homes for the purpose of discovering child abuse? Or is the Court prepared to hold as a matter of constitutional law that a mother, merely because she is poor, is substantially more likely to injure or exploit her child?” 

[Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309 (1971) (Marshall dissent).]

> Some scholars believe the psychosocial effects of poverty increase the actual incidence of abuse;others, that scarce resources make it difficult for children to handle the consequences of otherwise commonplace parental neglect; still others, that the hypervisibility of poor people—to the state—makes them likelier to draw attention from officials who are empowered or obliged to report suspected abuse.
>
> The surveillance apparatus of the welfare state behaves, in effect, as a substitute for more generous aid—leaving no stone unturned in its zeal to root out bad behavior, as the system defines it, that implicitly blames the moral flaws of poor mothers for the indigence of their children.

## Administering the VISPDAT and Asking Intrusive Questions 

An impoverished single mother on Medicaid faces mortifying questions, face-to-face with benefit managers, about her lovers, hygiene, parental shortcomings, and personal habits. For example,

> Tina  (“T”):  Are  you  working?
> 
> Erica  (“E”):  No — I’m in college still.
> 
> T:  How  are  you  supporting  yourself?
> 
> E: [long pause] How could I forget what it’s called . . . . Welfare! 
> 
> [laughs]
> 
> T:  You  receive  public  assistance?
> 
> E:  Yes.
> 
> T:  How  much?
> 
> E:  Um,  354  .  .  .  .
> 
> T:  And  does  that  include  what  they  give  you  for  your  rent?
> 
> E: Yes.  Well, I don’t pay rent.
> 
> T: You don’t pay rent?
> 
> E:  I  live  in  a  shelter.
> 
> T:  What  shelter  do  you  live  in?
> 
> E:  Beta  Houses.
> 
> T:  Who’s your caseworker?
> 
> E:  Ms.  C.
> 
> T:  Do  you  have  the  number?
> 
> E: Yeah — I have the number: 1-212-555-1212.  She has an extension:  1212.
> 
> T:  And  how  long  have  you  been  there?
> 
> E:  Almost  four  months.
> 
> T: And can you tell me what the circumstances were that put you in  shelter?
> 
> E:  Domestic  violence.
> 
> T:  And  how  long  did  the  domestic  violence  last?
> 
> E:  Two  months.
> 
> T: So, you were in a domestic violence relationship for about two months,  and  then  you  moved  to  a  shelter.
> 
> E:  Uh-huh.
> 
> T:  And  how  long  was  your  relationship?
> 
> E: It wasn’t really a relationship.  It was, like, I would say — three months.
> 
> T: I’m sorry?
> 
> E:  Three  months — it  was,  like,  a  three-month  relationship.
> 
> T:  It  was  a  three-month  relationship.   And  do  you  have  a  police report  and  an  order  of  protection?
> 
> E: The police report, yes.  Not the order of protection — still didn’t get  it.
> 
> T: Would you like to talk to someone about the domestic violence?
> 
> E:  No  .  .  .  . 
> 
> T: Who’s the father of the baby?
> 
> E:  Nathanial  Thompson.
> 
> T:  Is  the  father  of  the  baby  living  with  you?
> 
> E:  No.
> 
> T:  How  long  have  you  been  in  a  relationship  with  the  father?
> 
> E:  10  years.
> 
> T:  The  father  of  the  baby?
> 
> E:  Uh-huh.   Same  father  as  all  the  rest  of  them.
> 
> T:  How  old  is  he?
> 
> E:  How  old?   34.
> 
> T:  Can  you  identify  the  father?
> 
> E:  Yes  .  .  .  .
> 
> T:  What’s his name?
> 
> E:  Nathanial  Thompson.
> 
> T: And how would you describe your relationship with the father?
> 
> E:  Fine — now.
> 
> T:  “Fine  now”?
> 
> E:  Uh-huh.
> 
> T:  Does  he  intend  to  help  when  the  baby  comes?
> 
> E:  Yes — he’s my fiancé.I  just  didn’t  get  my  ring  yet.   He  better hurry  up.
> 
> T:  Is  he  working?
> 
> E: Yes.  No, he doesn’t work.  Sorry.  He’s in college.
> 
> T:  How  does  he  support  himself?
> 
> E: I know that he’s on public assistance, but I don’t know what he gets  or  anything  like  that.
> 
> T:  But,  he’s  going  to  able  to  support  you  and  your  child?
> 
> E: Yes, he’s going to get a job by the time — he’s about to be done with  college.
> 
> T:  You  feel  that  when  he’s  done  with  school,  he’s  going  to  be  financially  able  to  support  the  child?
> 
> E:  He’s  going  to  be  making  43,000  [dollars]  a  year.
> 
> T:  You  know  that  already?
> 
> E:  Yes.   His  job  is  already  set  up.
> 
> T:  What  does  he  do?
> 
> E: He’s a computer technician.  I don’t know how he does it.  I hate computers.
> 
> T:  You  are  in  a  better  situation  than  a  lot  of  our  patients.
> 
> E:  I  just  have  to  get  up  out  this  dag-gone  shelter.   Then,  I’ll  be fine.

> What  is  remarkable  about  this  exchange  is  that  Erica  was  led  into  a conversation  about  a  romantic  relationship  that  tragically  involved  severe, homelessness-inducing violence, the healthiness of her relationship with the father  of  her  children,  her  earnings  capacity,  the  earnings  capacity  of  the father  of  her  children,  and  any  previous  contact  that  she  had  had  with  the welfare  state  (in  addition  to  answering  questions  about  her  history,  if  any, with tobacco and alcohol products, controlled substances, mental illness, and a host of other issues that I have not included in this excerpted portion of the interview) because  she  was  pregnant  and  had  presented  herself  to  a  public hospital with the hope of receiving state-assisted prenatal care .  It is important to observe at the outset that this is an intensely personal, painfully intimate   conversation   that   privately-insured   pregnant   women   can   avoid enduring.
