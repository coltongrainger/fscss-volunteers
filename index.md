- [application](https://www.volgistics.com/ex/portal.dll/ap?ap=1953929563) for volunteers, interns, work-studies

## Helping at the Family Support Center

Volunteers, interns, and work-studies keep our family shelter, [Pear Blossom Place][pbp], open 24 hours a day. We schedule at least 2 people to work each shift. Though staff only work 7:00am -- 5:00pm, there is always an on-call staff in case of an emergency.

The [main office][fsc] houses a large donation room for our clients' use. People may access this room whenever the office is open. We need help unpacking, sorting, and distributing goods.

We will also need help running [special events](/events) that support families and children. When possible, we coordinate group meals, birthday parties, and educational activities.
