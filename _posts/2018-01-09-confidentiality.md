A full name, physical address, or telephone number, if disclosed, could wreck havoc on someone's life. This is an outline of practical confidentiality for volunteers, interns, and work-studies at shelter.

## Policy and Exceptions

From [Model Protocol on Confidentiality when Working with Battered Women](https://wscadv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Confidentiality-When-Working-with-Battered-Women.pdf)
> It is [recommended] policy to hold confidential all communications, observations and information made by, between or about program participants. This includes all program participant, service and administrative records resulting from *telephone contacts*, and *any other work* related to recipients of service.
> 
> Communications are confidential whether made by adults or children, and whether to or between staff, volunteers, student interns or board members of this organization.
> 
> There are a limited number of exceptions to breaching the confidentiality of program participants. These exceptions are as follows:
> - Duty to report [child abuse or neglect](safety) (RWC 26.44.030);
> - Duty to warn of an imminent threat of harm to self or others (this is known as a Tarasoff warning, based on case law);
> - Following a court order, after a judge privately reviews program participant
> records (RCW 70.123.075); or
> - When given express permission by the program participant to release information. 

## Recommended Procedures

From [HOWTO: Answer the phone](answering-phone):
> Do not disclose if someone is (or is not) staying in shelter. 
> 
> For example
> - "I can neither confirm nor deny..."
> - "Do you have another way to get ahold of them?"
> - "I can take a message and leave it on our community board."
> - "I can take your contact information and post it on our community board."
> 
> Remind clients in shelter and folks calling in that our services are *confidential*. 

How do we handle legitimate external requests for information?
> Requests for information by any third party (e.g., [school administrators,] child protective services, prosecutors, mental health providers, friends or family), including the program participant’s attorney, will not be honored without express *written permission* (or verbal consent in person, depending) from the program participant, with the exception of mandatory reporting of child abuse/neglect or a “duty to warn” circumstance.  
>
> All communications are confidential, even when shared *by the program participant* in the presence of [staff] and any third parties who are working on behalf of the program participant.

At minimum, a release of information should answer decisively:
> - Why does this person (or institution) need this particular information?
> - What is the immediate or long-term imp act on the program participant?  (For example, could the release of information be damaging to the program participant in a custody hearing?)
> - Does disclosing this information create an expectation that similar information will be disclosed about other program participants in the future?

## Rubric for internal communication 

> There are different situations in which staff members or volunteers need to share information about the program participant with in the agency, such as at staff meetings, during or changing shifts or when problem solving. 
>
> Advocates are allowed to share information a bout the program participant with other staff members and volunteers to get *technical assistance and emotional support*.  Advocates should avoid sharing detailed information about a program participant or information that is not directly relevant to providing services (such as HIV, chemical dependency or immigration status).

We ought to protect a program participant’s confidentiality and privacy by:

1. Ensuring that exchanges with other co-workers are necessary for the program participant’s safety or to provide services in the most thorough manner.

2. Ensuring program participants’ privacy when sharing information with other co-workers.

3. Ensuring that program participants do not overhear information about others using agency services.

4. Instituting a policy for advocates (on the crisis line or in other positions) who are acquainted with, are friends with or family members of any person seeking services that they refer the program participant to another staff member.

5. Ensuring that program participants’ confidentiality is protected with people outside of the agency, even when they are friends and family.  Advocates should not share information (even without disc losing the individual’s name), as other people may recognize a particular program participant’s story.

6. Ensuring program participant information is not shared across organizations if advocates, volunteers or relief workers work at multiple agencies.

7. Protecting program participant information when assisting in transfer to another shelter.  In that situation, the advocate will have a release of information signed by the program participant and specifying to what extent the advocate can share information.  The advocate will arrange for the program participant to be present when information is shared.
