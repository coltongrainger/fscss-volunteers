A full name, physical address, or telephone number, if disclosed, could wreck havoc on someone's life. This is an outline of practical confidentiality for volunteers, interns, and work-studies at shelter.

## Recommended Policy 

From [Model Protocol on Confidentiality when Working with Battered Women](https://wscadv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Confidentiality-When-Working-with-Battered-Women.pdf)
> It is [recommended] policy to hold confidential all communications, observations and information made by, between or about program participants. This includes all program participant, service and administrative records resulting from *telephone contacts*, and *any other work* related to recipients of service.
> 
> Communications are confidential whether made by adults or children, and whether to or between staff, volunteers, student interns or board members of this organization.
> 
> There are a limited number of exceptions to breaching the confidentiality of program participants. These exceptions are as follows:
> - Duty to report [child abuse or neglect](safety) (RWC 26.44.030);
> - Duty to warn of an imminent threat of harm to self or others (this is known as a Tarasoff warning, based on case law);
> - Following a court order, after a judge privately reviews program participant
> records (RCW 70.123.075); or
> - When given express permission by the program participant to release information. 

## Recommended Procedures

From [HOWTO: Answer the phone]/answering-phone):
> Do not disclose if someone is (or is not) staying in shelter. 
> 
> For example
> - "I can neither confirm nor deny..."
> - "Do you have another way to get ahold of them?"
> - "I can take a message and leave it on our community board."
> - "I can take your contact information and post it on our community board."
> 
> Remind clients in shelter and folks calling in that our services are *confidential*. 

 
The [Model Protocol on Confidentiality](https://wscadv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Confidentiality-When-Working-with-Battered-Women.pdf) also recommends that
> Requests for information by any third party (e.g., [school administrators,] child protective services, prosecutors, mental health providers, friends or family), including the program participant’s attorney, will not be honored without express *written permission* (or verbal consent in person, depending) from the program participant, with the exception of mandatory reporting of child abuse/neglect or a “duty to warn” circumstance.  
>  
> All communications are confidential, even when shared *by the program participant* in the presence of [staff] and any third parties who are working on behalf of the program participant.
