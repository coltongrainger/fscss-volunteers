# Opportunities

Volunteers keep our family shelter, Pear Blossom Place, open 24 hours a day. We schedule at least 2 volunteers to work each shift. Though staff only work 7:00am -- 5:00pm, there is always an on-call staff in case of an emergency.

The downtown office houses a large donation room for our client's use. Volunteers may access this room whenever the office is open. It is in constant need of TLC.

We will also schedule volunteers for [special events](/events.html) that support families and children. When possible, we coordinate group meals, birthday parties, and educational activities.
