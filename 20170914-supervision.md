# VISTA Project Proposal

Despite serving more families, being full every night, the resources do not exist to have staff on-site 24/7, thus volunteers continue to be a critical asset to the program. This VISTA project will increase the organization’s volunteer recruitment capacity, providing the opportunity to participate in key community outreach events, volunteer fairs, and build relationships with local schools and colleges in order to sustain the volunteer component at Pear Blossom Place.

The VISTA project will also support with identifying potential financial and in-kind resources to maintain and increase the services available on-site at Pear Blossom Place for homeless families with children. This includes directly coordinating the Family Support Center’s annual holiday adoption program, connecting families at Pear Blossom Place with individuals and businesses in the community for holiday assistance.

The​ Strengthening​ Homeless​ Families​ VISTA​ project​ will​ work​ to​ directly​ increase​ the​ capacity​ and availability​ of​ services​ at​ Pear​ Blossom​ Place.​ Volunteer​ recruitment​ will​ be​ a ​ core​ component​ of​ their service​ year.​ Recruitment​ and​ development​ of​ sustainable​ relationships​ with​ community​ groups​ such​ as Rotary,​ Kiwanis,​ Zonta,​ and​ other​ service​ clubs,​ colleges​ and​ universities,​ high​ schools,​ and​ other​ civic groups.​ The​ VISTA​ member​ will​ be​ responsible​ for​ establishing​ and​ nurturing​ the​ relationships,​ including building​ in​ modes​ of​ sustainability​ in​ the​ relationships​ (ie:​ Rotary​ Club​ X ​ makes​ 12-month​ commitment​ to cover​ 1 ​ shift​ a ​ week).​ The​ VISTA​ member​ will​ also​ establish​ a ​ resource​ development​ plan​ specific​ to​ Pear Blossom​ Place,​ identifying​ potential​ in-kind​ resources,​ financial​ opportunities​ such​ as​ grant​ and​ foundation support.​ Deadlines,​ requirements,​ contact​ information​ will​ be​ fathered​ by​ the​ VISTA​ member.​ Any proposals​ due​ during​ their​ VISTA​ term​ will​ be​ lead​ by​ the​ VISTA​ member,​ with​ support​ of​ their​ direct supervisor​ and​ the​ Development​ Director.​ The​ increased​ volunteer​ capacity​ and​ financial/in-kind​ resources will​ help​ to​ ensure​ the​ overall​ success​ of​ Pear​ Blossom​ Place,​ including​ the​ capacity​ of​ direct​ service​ staff’s ability​ to​ transition​ families​ from​ homelessness​ to​ permanent​ housing.
