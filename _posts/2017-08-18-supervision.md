This is a living document for Colton's supervision.

# To-do
- static state shelter narrative
	- records on individual clients?
- backup list for winter volunteers
- more communication with Keiya
- explore emacs org mode
- more workshops for volunteer retention
- address child abuse/sexual abuse

# Recruitment

In terms of drumming up motivation to volunteer, I focus either *for children* or *for families*. We can help kids avoid adverse childhood experiences. We can help families manage competing (often insurmountable?) obligations.
> Today the emphasis is on keeping together families that would have been separated in the past. These families have complex needs, often involving some sort of child maltreatment, substance abuse, or children exhibiting oppositional behavior or deliquency in the home, school, and community[^crosson]. The goal of family preservation programs are to: allow children to remain safely [housed], maintain and strengthen family bonds, stabilize the crisis situation that precipitated any need for outside placement, increase the family's coping skills and competencies, and facilitate the family's use of appropriate and information helping resources.

How to rank family support in terms of [cause prioritization?](https://causeprioritization.org/_categories) I think it's important to compile examples of long term successes (i.e., improved cognition after removal from a traumatic environment, increased standard of living, decreased ecological footprint, advocacy for survivors of violence, dialogue surrounding violence). Should I demonstrate that shelter (with each client here for an average of 120 days) disrupts and reframes the "coordinates of social reality"?

> The act, therefore, `always involves a radical risk ... it is a step into the open, with no gauranee about the final outcome.' This is not because of the suppposed complexity of a situation, our inability to accurately predict the consequences of an intervention, but because `an act retroactively changes the very coordinates into which it itervenes' and so retroactively also creates (or fails to create) the conditions of its legitimation. It is for this reason that the same gesture can come to be seen as a genuine act or as a `ridiculous empty posture', depending on whether and how the socio-symbolic coordinates have changed in the wake of the act itself. (Jason Glynos, Ch. 12, *Lacan, Discourse, Event: New Psychoanalytic Approaches to Textual Indeterminacy.* [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu_eAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA152)

What about locality? Does proximity to shelter provide stronger imperative to volunteer? I think only so much as effort directed towards a community social support system is multiplied when focused locally. In other words, local volunteers have a comparative advantage to non-local (external) workers charged to "aid" and "reform" a community. 

What about individual "turning points"? Persons in recovery from substance abuse (or from addiction in a more general sense) could be motivated to mentor or sponsor others in fulfillment of an obligation to return services rendered. I am personally most responsive to arguments that shelter creates the space for healing (which I take literally, thinking in terms of cognitive plasticity).
