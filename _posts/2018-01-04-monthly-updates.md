How many volunteers helped last month? What sort of work did volunteers do? This page logs volunteer service at shelter and significant events. Since some volunteers take shifts in multiple positions, the monthly totals do not sum exactly.

## December 2017

- During the HELP portrait event, volunteer photographers captured and developed portraits for families in the community. 
- Volunteers also distributed gifts to families from donors in a 180-household "holiday adoption". 
- Nature Nutures Farm sponsored two half-day field trips for kids at shelter.
- With the end of the academic semester, we bid a number of interns goodbye and renegiotated service learning projects with Evergreen, Saint Martin's, Pacific Lutheran, and Washington State.
