## Fall 2017 Opportunities

Volunteers keep our family shelter, Pear Blossom Place, open 24 hours a day. Though staff only work 7:00am -- 5:00pm, there is always an on-call staff in case of an emergency.

The downtown office houses a large donation room for our client's use. Volunteers may access this room whenever the office is open. It is in constant need of TLC.

We will also schedule volunteers for special events that support families and children. When possible, we coordinate group meals, birthday parties, and educational activities.
