To compile all the disparate tips for talking on the phone during a shelter shift. I'm documenting the instructions from previous staff members and removing redunant information. 

# Answering the phone. 

Who is calling us?
- Families looking for shelter
- Single individuals looking for shelter
- People looking for a staff person
- A domestic violence survivor fleeing and looking for shelter
- Families calling looking for rental assistance, support
- Law enforcement, social workers, hospital staff calling on behalf of someone looking for shelter

Ask clarifying questions.
- Do you have children? 
- Have you been to our agency before?
- Where are you located?
- Do you need shelter tonight?

We want to make sure that we support the caller, understand their needs, and give meaningful and helpful referrals. (I have admittedly made useless referrals to Aberdeen---it's a shelter for women and children, but I often forget and refer families with males.)

On nights when we donâ€™t have shelter space:
- Have you gone into the Family Support Center office? 
- Do you have anywhere else you can stay tonight?
- Safe parking lots are often WalMart, churches, SafeWay, etc.
