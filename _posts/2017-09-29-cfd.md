I meet with Hanna Hillig from SSRF. I would like to begin either a "adopt a day care" or "read with me" program at shelter. (read2me@nthurston.k12.wa.us) The potential benefits: (i) Hanna would have a chance to engage in her professional capacity, (ii) at least 5 children would be exposed to additional vocabulary, (iii) there's the possibility of monthly recurring reading hours between SSRF and TRL, (iv) volunteer involvement with an event. Some downsides: (i) transportation costs for Hanna, (ii) risk that few kiddos are in the building, (iii) age-inappropriate books, (iv) unwanted donations.
