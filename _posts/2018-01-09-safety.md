To comment on safety (volunteers, staff or clients) you may email [safety@fscss.org](mailto:safety.fscss.org). Moreover, if someone is injured on property, we sshould give details on the incident and our response by completing an [physical injury report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSea_vVLzfiE70EvqeUa1G4BilgGLE1JknYEdQEO43TxEuJIkg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Reporting Child Abuse/Neglect

We can take note of unsafe behavior in the comment section of the volunteer website, but occasionally, we'll recognize or suspect child abuse/neglect.

- One may discuss the situation with [Colton Grainger](coltong@fscss.org), [Keiya Johnson](mailto:keiyaj@fscss.org), [Natalie Skovran](mailto:natalies@fscss.org), or [Trish Gregory](trishg@fscss.org).
- Anyone witnessing child abuse/neglect needs to report abuse/neglect to Child Protective Services (1-866-END-HARM) within 48 hours of the witnessed event. 
- ["Recognize, Record, Report"](https://prezi.com/piml7bn_b0au/mandatory-reporter-presentation/)
- Keep track of the following:
	- Date and time of calls to Child Protective Services 
	- Child’s name
	- Child’s age/birthdate
	- Address
	- Name and address of parent or guardian and other children in the home (if known)
	- Any statements made by the child (DO NOT interview child)
	- The nature and extent of the injury or injuries, neglect, and/or sexual abuse
	- Any evidence of previous incidences of abuse or neglect, including nature and extent
	- Any other information which may be helpful in establishing the cause of the child’s injury or injuries, neglect or death, and the identity of the perpetrator or perpetrators.

*These reports may become legal documents. They are confidential to the reporter and any supervising Family Support Center staff.*
