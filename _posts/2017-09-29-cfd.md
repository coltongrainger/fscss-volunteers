I meet with Hanna Hillig from SSRF. I would like to begin either a "adopt a day care" or "read with me" program at shelter. (read2me@nthurston.k12.wa.us) 

- benefits
	- Hanna would have a chance to engage in her professional capacity, 
	- at least 5 children would be exposed to additional vocabulary, 
	- there's the possibility of monthly recurring reading hours between SSRF and TRL, 
	- volunteer involvement 
- downsides
	- transportation costs for Hanna, 
	- risk that few kiddos are in the building, 
	- age-inappropriate books, 
	- unwanted donations.

Other organizations:
- Ethiopian Community in Seattle
	- case management
	- not a resettlment agency
- Seattle Children's
	- vision
		- preventative healthcare
		- neighborhood centers

	- whole wheat pasta
