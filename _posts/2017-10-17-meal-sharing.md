Today I spoke with Gabbi Korrow. After boiling about 8 packets of top ramen for the kids, we brainstormed a process for future meal sharing. Here are the highlights. 

We have a budget for volunteer food. Let's focus: not just corn syrup solids and enriched flour. As well, [Thurston County Foodbank](http://thurstoncountyfoodbank.org/satellite-locations/) distributes MWF from 10am--3pm. Can we receive food on behalf of others? Maybe, but the [requirements](http://thurstoncountyfoodbank.org/80-2/) to begin with are pretty lax.
> There are no income guidelines to access regular services at the food bank and it is free of charge. If possible, please bring picture I.D. and a current piece of mail.... Our basic service is a **weekâ€™s worth of food** for each family.

Sound's like plenty for a weekly meal at shelter.

- whole wheat pasta
- pasta sauces
- nut/seed butters
- fruits w/o syrup
- brown rice
- quinoa
- cereal
- rolled oats
- tortillas
- canned soups
- canned veggies
- tuna
- salmon
- sardines
- beans
- lentils

We need to account for dishes. Dishes daunt over volunteers and residents for meal sharing. Let's plan for 100 [disposable bowls](https://www.ecoproductsstore.com/sugarcane_bowls.html) for every 90 days?

I also would like about 1 week's notice to organize the meal as a night activity. Perhaps we can ask the greeters to start soup? Then to eat at 7pm? 

Gabbi asked to share the recipes beforehand. 
- Zucchini boats? 
- Lasagna? 
- Breakfast for dinner?
	- French toast?
