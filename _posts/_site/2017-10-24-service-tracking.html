<p>I can vouch for accurate hours beginning 9/1/2017. Why not earlier?</p>

<h1 id="what-about-prior-service-hours">What about prior service hours?</h1>
<p>In brief: My predecessor set up Volgistics for manual hour entry. Out of some 150 (more or less) active volunteers, only 15 folks used VicNet to report their hours. In turn, only 10% of our collective effort is recorded in Volgistics.</p>

<p>Not to be discouraged!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world is watching: one cannot walk through a meadow or forest without a ripple of report spreading out from one’s passage. The thrush darts back, the jay squalls, a beetle scuttles under the grasses, and the signal is passed along. Every creature knows when a hawk is cruising or a human strolling. The information passed through the system is intelligence. (<a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/The-Practice-of-the-Wild-by-Gary-Snyder.pdf">Gary Synder, 1990</a>)</p>

<p>If you need accurate records prior to 9/1/2017, I suggest:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Interpolate from partial information in Volgistics (I could help model your hours per month).</li>
  <li>Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem#cite_ref-2">Fermi estimate</a> (i.e., use a series of probable approximations to the truth.)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-changed">What changed?</h1>

<p>I will post hours directly from the schedule from September 2017 onwards (with some auditing in case of no-shows, late arrivals, etc).</p>

<p>The schedule closely relfects our service. Keiya and I keep the schedule meticulously updated. When a volunteer doesn’t show up, we have to find a replacement, and we update the schedule. When a volunteer arrives late, we change the schedule.</p>

<p>Posting hours from the schedule has two benefits.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There’s no need for volunteers to make redundant reports in VicNet.</li>
  <li>In about 5 minutes, I can post <em>everyone’s</em> hours from the last 7 days.</li>
</ol>
