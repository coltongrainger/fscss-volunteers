<p>To compile all the disparate tips for talking on the phone during a shelter shift. I’m documenting the instructions from previous staff members and removing redunant information.</p>

<h1 id="answering-the-phone">Answering the phone.</h1>

<p>Who is calling us?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Families looking for shelter</li>
  <li>Single individuals looking for shelter</li>
  <li>People looking for a staff person</li>
  <li>A domestic violence survivor fleeing and looking for shelter</li>
  <li>Families calling looking for rental assistance, support</li>
  <li>Law enforcement, social workers, hospital staff calling on behalf of someone looking for shelter</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask clarifying questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have children?</li>
  <li>Have you been to our agency before?</li>
  <li>Where are you located?</li>
  <li>Do you need shelter tonight?</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to make sure that we support the caller, understand their needs, and give meaningful and helpful referrals. (I have admittedly made useless referrals to Aberdeen—it’s a shelter for women and children, but I often forget and refer families with males.)</p>

<p>On nights when we don’t have shelter space:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you gone into the Family Support Center office?</li>
  <li>Do you have anywhere else you can stay tonight?</li>
  <li>Safe parking lots are often WalMart, churches, SafeWay, etc.</li>
</ul>
