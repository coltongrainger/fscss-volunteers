      <h1 id="consent-to-background-check">Consent to Background Check</h1>

<p>I give my permission for the Family Support Center of South Sound (FSCSS) to conduct a search of my background to determine my qualifications for interning/volunteering.</p>

<p>I understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FSCSS requires my social security number to perform the search,</li>
  <li>I have a right to view the results, and</li>
  <li>FSCSS will not disclose the results to another party without my permission,</li>
</ul>

<p>I consent to the following searches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>criminal background
    <ul>
      <li>including Washington State,</li>
      <li>national criminal, and</li>
      <li>sex offender databases,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>personal references,</li>
  <li>CAMIS/DSHS clearance for Child Abuse and Neglect</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="confidentiality-agreement">Confidentiality Agreement</h1>

<p>Basic to the maintenance of the professional ethics and community respect is the principle of confidentiality. Every employee, contracted professional, and volunteer of FSCSS has a high ethical responsibility to the families, the programs, the community, and to themselves. Families and individuals act in good faith, expecting their circumstances and personal matters to remain confidential. We are obligated by law and ethics to reciprocate.</p>

<p>The records that are kept on clients should be used only for the program purposes and not for general perusal. Other agencies’ operations requesting records of a given family member or persons should first obtain releases of information from the family member of individual. In no case should the records be automatically sent to another person or agency without first receiving a release specific to the information in question.</p>

<p>Remember that persons always have immediate access to their data on file. Keep all information to facts and not speculation.</p>

<p><em>The only exception to this ruling is mandated report of abuse &amp; neglect to childer and vulnerable adults as described an in accordance with Washington State laws and regulations.</em></p>

<p>The following is presented to provide some guidlines concerning matters of confidentiality and the rights of the persons who participate in our programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The right to have all records kept from public scrutiny and the right to anonymity and confidentiality</li>
  <li>The right to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
  <li>The right to a timely response.</li>
  <li>The right to a response that is non-discriminatory to the differences of
    <ul>
      <li>race,</li>
      <li>religion,</li>
      <li>language,</li>
      <li>gender identity,</li>
      <li>sexual orientation,</li>
      <li>disability,</li>
      <li>veteran status,</li>
      <li>socioeconomic condition,</li>
      <li>marital status, and/or</li>
      <li>pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I understand and agree to the above policy and statement. I am aware that any breach of confidentiality is grounds for dismissal.</p>

<p>I agree to maintain client confidentiality at all times. All information, written or spoken, that I come into contact with while performing my volunteer duties is considered confidential and will not be released unless specified by law.</p>
