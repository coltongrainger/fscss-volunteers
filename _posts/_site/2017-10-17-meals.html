<p>Today I spoke with Gabbi Korrow. After boiling about 8 packets of top ramen for the kids, we brainstormed a process for future meal sharing. Here are the highlights.</p>

<p>We have a budget for volunteer food. Let’s focus: not just corn syrup solids and enriched flour. As well, <a href="http://thurstoncountyfoodbank.org/satellite-locations/">Thurston County Foodbank</a> distributes MWF from 10am–3pm. Can we receive food on behalf of others? Maybe, but the <a href="http://thurstoncountyfoodbank.org/80-2/">requirements</a> to begin with are pretty lax.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are no income guidelines to access regular services at the food bank and it is free of charge. If possible, please bring picture I.D. and a current piece of mail…. Our basic service is a <strong>week’s worth of food</strong> for each family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound’s like plenty for a weekly meal at shelter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>whole wheat pasta</li>
  <li>pasta sauces</li>
  <li>nut/seed butters</li>
  <li>fruits w/o syrup</li>
  <li>brown rice</li>
  <li>quinoa</li>
  <li>cereal</li>
  <li>rolled oats</li>
  <li>torillas</li>
  <li>canned soups</li>
  <li>canned veggies</li>
  <li>tuna</li>
  <li>salmon</li>
  <li>sardines</li>
  <li>beans</li>
  <li>lentils</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to account for dishes. Dishes daunt over volunteers and residents for meal sharing. Let’s plan for 100 <a href="https://www.ecoproductsstore.com/sugarcane_bowls.html">disposable bowls</a> for every 90 days?</p>

<p>I also would like about 1 week’s notice to organize the meal as a night activity. Perhaps we can ask the greeters to start soup? Then to eat at 7pm?</p>

<p>Gabbi asked to share the recipes beforehand.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zucchini boats?</li>
  <li>Lasanga?</li>
  <li>Breakfast for dinner?
    <ul>
      <li>French toast?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
