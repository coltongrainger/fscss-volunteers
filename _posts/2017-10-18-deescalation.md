## Scenarios

The teen daughter of the family in room 106  is out late past curfew; there are rumors that she’s been sneaking out of shelter to go drink with her friends. The father approaches you and asks that if she shows up that you do not let her in; he says she gets belligerent when she’s drunk and doesn’t want her to wake her sisters or other cause a disturbance for other families in shelter, and feels this will teach her a lesson. 

It’s late after staff have left, and there are two families in room 103 that are arguing through-out the night; nothing has reached the point of being threatening or violent, but it’s progressing louder and it’s getting more heated. It eventually gets to the point where one of them is demanding to change room... however, we have no more space available, and the other families are not willing to switch rooms around.
