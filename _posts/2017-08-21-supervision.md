For supervision, here's an outline of projects that I'm working on.

# Shelter Rules and Regulations

- I created an outline of shelter [responsibilities](volunteer.fscss.org/responsibilities). It's a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document), in the sense that (i) it's seasonal, and (ii) I'm looking for collaborative feedback from staff, volunteers, and clients. To-do: simplify & change to infinitive tense.

# Blog

- increases transparency
	- also to coordinate administrative responsibilities
- success stories?
	- what about tragedies?
- can we incorperate economic concepts into narratives
> price elasticity of demand, supply and demand, Overton window (not econ), broken windows, ideological turning tests, make-work bias, ideas from thinking fast and slow (source: [Issa Rice](https://issarice.com/advice-for-young-people#other-ideasexpanding-your-imagination))
- Keiya's observations on Olympia

To-do:
- define limits & scope
- expectations for number & quality of posts
- Natalie needs to review: to what extent?

# Recruitment

- What's our mission?
- bifocal: either *for children* or *for families*
	- what's the ideological motivation to donate time? service?
	- preventing adverse childhood experiences?
	- navigating competing obligations
> Today the emphasis is on keeping together families that would have been separated in the past. These families have complex needs, often involving some sort of child maltreatment, substance abuse, or children exhibiting oppositional behavior or deliquency in the home, school, and community[^crosson]. The goal of family preservation programs are to: allow children to remain safely [housed], maintain and strengthen family bonds, stabilize the crisis situation that precipitated any need for outside placement, increase the family's coping skills and competencies, and facilitate the family's use of appropriate and information helping resources.
- should our cause be prioritized? 
	- examples of long term successes?

	- benefits
		- Hanna would have a chance to engage in her professional capacity,
