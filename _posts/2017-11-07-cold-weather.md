## Cold Weather Shelter

*If you take away one piece of information from these minutes: Volunteers are not expected to stay up on night when we open the building for cold weather shelter.*

On nights where the temp drops belows 36 deg F, the Family Support Center of South Sound (FSCSS) opens Pear Blossom Place (PBP) as an emergency shelter from 7pm--7am. It's possible that Thurston county may approve funding for a cold weather season (11/15/17--04/30/18), in which case PBP will be open every night for emergency shelter. 

### Building capacity is 70 people.
The fire marshall has set the Smith building's (1st floor) capacity at 70 persons. With 37 long-term residents, 2 volunteers, and 1 staff person, we have room for 30 extra people. First come, first serve.

### Hours are 7pm--7am.
Cold weather shelter runs from 7pm to 7am, with FSCSS paid staff arriving at 6:45pm to screen people for entry. Volunteers do not need to let in cold weather clients until a few minutes before 7pm. Instead, encourage families to visit the Salvation Army for dinner, then return at 7pm. (TODO: create map of heated buildings open to the public.)

### Screened entry: check if registered sex offender.
The *first* time someone comes for cold weather shelter, we need to run their first/last name through the [sex offender registry](https://www.nsopw.gov/). Volunteers are welcome to search the sex offender registry, especially if they are letting someone in before FSCSS staff arrive. *Registered Sex Offenders may not stay on property.* FSCSS staff will complete [coordinated entry](https://deptofcommerce.app.box.com/s/8nt4mgmr3izkj9juizisji9w6igdgjd6) paperwork for enrollment in the [Homeless Management Information System](http://www.commerce.wa.gov/serving-communities/homelessness/hmis/), which also connects the family in the to additional social services. 

### Sleeping Arrangements
We keep additional mats, blankets, and pillows in the bike closet. Note: 30 people require lots of room: both the the bike closet and the living room will be crowded. FSCSS staff will move furniture around 8:45pm to make room on the floor to sleep. The lights do not turn off (by order of the fire marshal).

We ask long-term shelter residents to retire to their rooms after 9pm. (Note: this is not a hard rule. It's more important that the kids go to their rooms at 9pm than their parents.) We want to block off time for cold weather families to sleep.

### No personal belongings during daytime.
We do not allow cold weather families to leave belongings in the shelter during the day. (Food left behind is usually eaten. Belongings can be stolen. As well, we don't have the capacity to hold either food or belongings.) 

### No laundry or showers on site
We do not permit cold weather families to do laundry, cook with the stove or oven, or shower. They may use the microwave to heat food. If someone's health is at risk (and at our discretion) families may shower or launder blankents and clothing.

We provide shower vouchers for the [YMCA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Sound+YMCA+-+Downtown+YMCA/@47.0438296,-122.9686698,12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sYMCA+olympia!3m4!1s0x5491751bc115f4a1:0x3399d2a90110a045!8m2!3d47.043851!4d-122.8986301) and the [Community Care Center](http://washington.providence.org/clinics/providence-community-care-center/) (families may also do laundry here). We keep vouchers in a silver file cabinet under the front desk.

### Where to go during the day?

At 7am (or 9am, depending on FSCSS staff discretion) we ask families to leave Pear Blossom Place. We can support families by referring them to these heated buildings during the day.
