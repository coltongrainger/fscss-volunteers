## Volunteer Opportunities

The family homeless shelter, Pear Blossom Place, is kept open 24/7 because of **shift volunteers**. There is always at least one staff person on site from 9am at the latest to 5pm at the earliest seven days a week. During the week the shelter has interns and work study staff that also work 9am--5pm.

Volunteer shifts are **Overnight Hosts**, **Greeters**, and **Weekend/Holiday Daytime**. The overnight host shift is 12 hours with the opportunity to sleep. The greeter shift is 2.5 hours as parents are arriving home from work and getting their dinners prepared. The weekend/holiday daytime shifts are 4 hours when interns and work study staff are not available.

As well, the donation room is on site at the Family Support Center office in downtown Olympia. It is accessible for **walk-in volunteering** 9am--5pm M--F. This room is in constant need of TLC.
