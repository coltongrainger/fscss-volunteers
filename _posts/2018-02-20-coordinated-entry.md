## Frequently Asked Questions

Adapted directly from the [King County CE information](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/community-human-services/housing/services/homeless-housing/coordinated-entry/faqs.aspx).

1. What is Coordinated Entry?

CE ensures that people experiencing homelessness in Thurston County can get help finding stable housing by identifying, assessing, and connecting them to housing support services and housing resources. CE uses a standardized Housing Triage Tool that matches the right level of services and available housing resources to people experiencing homelessness.

2. How does CE work?

CE uses a triage tool, called the VI-SPDAT, to get more information about the needs of each homeless family or homeless person. In general, the triage tool asks a series of questions about you, your health, how you are experiencing homelessness, and what other needs you might have.

3. Who does CE serve?

CE serves all people (single adults, young adults, couples, families, and veterans) who are experiencing homelessness in King County. 

Additionally, young adults who are at risk of homelessness within 14 days can also receive CE services.

Being homeless means you are:
- Living and sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation,
- Fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence,
- Staying in an emergency shelter, or
- Exiting an institution where you stayed for up to 90 days and were homeless before entering that institution.

> Young adult means a person between 17.5 years old through 24 years old.
>
> Domestic violence means the person or family is afraid to return to their home or is experiencing dangerous or life threatening conditions at home, usually due to abuse, stalking, dating violence, sexual assault or other physical assault. Persons who have experienced human trafficking or sexual exploitation may also be served by CEA.
>
> Institution means a jail, prison, a psychiatric hospital, medical hospital, or a drug/alcohol treatment program.
