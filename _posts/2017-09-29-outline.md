## Feedback

> Talk about protocol. I feel like it changes a lot.

> I think [the families at PBP] need to be respectful of the other families that live at PBP and the volunteers that want to support them... they may need to work hard on not swearing or yelling or degrading their own children. 

> discuss consistency, for instance, the use of computer; set a time limit and stick to it. it doesn't matter if child is the only one in the common area. if 
kids begin to bang on the keyboard, argue or crowd each other; give 1 warning. then unplug it.

## Program Overview 

- Strengths perspective
	- "families are doing everything in their power to provide for their kiddos"
- persons experiencing homelessness
- about 3k school aged kids doubled up or unsheltered in thurston county
- Housing First Model
	- not worrying about the job, the license, etc
	- let's build a basis around housing

## Cause prioritization

- we run the VISPDAT for unsheltered famillies.
	- written by Thurston County
	- sleeping somewhere "not meant for human habitation"
	- accounts for medical vulnerability
	- chronicity of homelessness
- objective/subjective?
	- families sleeping in vans
	- right now 200 families on VI list

## Reflections? Reaction?

- Where should the program change?
- How does shelter fit in larger social movements? Which one?
- Is volunteering effective altruism?
