A full name, physical address, or telephone number, if disclosed, could wreck havoc on someone's life. This is an outline of practical confidentiality for volunteers, interns, and work-studies at shelter.

## Policy and Exceptions

From [Model Protocol on Confidentiality when Working with Battered Women](https://wscadv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Confidentiality-When-Working-with-Battered-Women.pdf)
> It is [recommended] policy to hold confidential all communications, observations and information made by, between or about program participants. This includes all program participant, service and administrative records resulting from *telephone contacts*, and *any other work* related to recipients of service.
> 
> Communications are confidential whether made by adults or children, and whether to or between staff, volunteers, student interns or board members of this organization.
> 
> There are a limited number of exceptions to breaching the confidentiality of program participants. These exceptions are as follows:
> - Duty to report [child abuse or neglect](safety) (RWC 26.44.030);
> - Duty to warn of an imminent threat of harm to self or others (this is known as a Tarasoff warning, based on case law);
> - Following a court order, after a judge privately reviews program participant
> records (RCW 70.123.075); or
> - When given express permission by the program participant to release information. 

## Recommended Procedures

From [HOWTO: Answer the phone](answering-phone):
> Do not disclose if someone is (or is not) staying in shelter. 
> 
> For example
> - "I can neither confirm nor deny..."
> - "Do you have another way to get ahold of them?"
> - "I can take a message and leave it on our community board."
> - "I can take your contact information and post it on our community board."
> 
> Remind clients in shelter and folks calling in that our services are *confidential*. 

How do we handle legitimate external requests for information?
> Requests for information by any third party (e.g., [school administrators,] child protective services, prosecutors, mental health providers, friends or family), including the program participant’s attorney, will not be honored without express *written permission* (or verbal consent in person, depending) from the program participant, with the exception of mandatory reporting of child abuse/neglect or a “duty to warn” circumstance.  
>
> All communications are confidential, even when shared *by the program participant* in the presence of [staff] and any third parties who are working on behalf of the program participant.

At minimum, a release of information should answer decisively:
> - Why does this person (or institution) need this particular information?
> - What is the immediate or long-term imp act on the program participant?  (For example, could the release of information be damaging to the program participant in a custody hearing?)
> - Does disclosing this information create an expectation that similar information will be disclosed about other program participants in the future?

## Internal Communication

> There are different situations in which staff members or volunteers need to share information about the program participant with in the agency, such as at staff meetings, during or changing shifts or when problem solving. 
>
> Advocates are allowed to share information a bout the program participant with other staff members and volunteers to get *technical assistance and emotional support*.  Advocates should avoid sharing detailed information about a program participant or information that is not directly relevant to providing services (such as HIV, chemical dependency or immigration status).

We ought to protect a program participant’s confidentiality and privacy by:

1. Ensuring that exchanges with other co-workers are necessary for the program participant’s safety or to provide services in the most thorough manner.

2. Ensuring program participants’ privacy when sharing information with other co-workers.

3. Ensuring that program participants do not overhear information about others using agency services.

4. Instituting a policy for advocates (on the crisis line or in other positions) who are acquainted with, are friends with or family members of any person seeking services that they refer the program participant to another staff member.

5. Ensuring that program participants’ confidentiality is protected with people outside of the agency, even when they are friends and family.  Advocates should not share information (even without disc losing the individual’s name), as other people may recognize a particular program participant’s story.

6. Ensuring program participant information is not shared across organizations if advocates, volunteers or relief workers work at multiple agencies.

7. Protecting program participant information when assisting in transfer to another shelter.  In that situation, the advocate will have a release of information signed by the program participant and specifying to what extent the advocate can share information.  The advocate will arrange for the program participant to be present when information is shared.

## Scenarios

[*Basic Educational Resource To Help Advocates: A practical guide to working at a domestic violence program in Washington State,* Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, reprinted January 2001, chapter 3, p. 38-39.]

> All programs have confidentiality policies. Most of these policies have a provision that states that workers within a program can tell *each other* about a client’s story. This is important because at times people will ask you questions you can’t answer. Everyone has the need for emotional support too. 
> 
> Technical assistance and emotional support are the two reasons why you are allowed to talk with your co-workers about the people who call on you for help.
> 
> Even though you can and should talk with your co-workers, you still need to think about how you go about doing that. Above all else, you must remember that all clients deserve respect and privacy.
> 
> Pretend that you have just received a crisis call from a woman who has a legal question and you don’t know what her options are. You go to one of your co-workers. Here are two ways you can ask your question:
> 
> 1. I just got a call from a woman who went to court this morning for a protection order – the judge denied it. She told me her story and I think she’s in a lot of danger. I read her written statement to the court and she didn’t write down any of the things that her husband did and threatened to do to harm her and the two kids. She didn’t have an advocate at court and she was too intimidated by the whole scene to tell the judge when the judge asked questions. So the court wouldn’t grant her an order. I’m a little confused about this. Can I go back with her this afternoon and help her reapply or what?
> 2. I just got a call from Sue May Hoddlestine. I think you must know her. Her two kids Stephanie and Clark go to school over at Jefferson and are about the same age as your kids. Well anyway, she went to court to get a protection order and the judge denied it. But really, she told me all this horrible stuff has happened to her. Her husband John, do you know him? He choked and raped her last week, and has beat her up over and over again in front of the kids. He beat the kids too. It’s awful. Anyway, the judge denied her petition for an order. Can I go back up there with her this afternoon and help her reapply or what?
> 
> Some people call us because they don’t have anyone else. Even those who have relatively good support systems choose to call a confidential service for help rather than confide in the people they are close to. Why? Perhaps because they want time to figure things out for themselves before being bombarded by advice from well meaning (but misguided) loved ones.
> 
> Some clients don’t care about privacy. They would just as soon publish their story on the front page of the newspaper. I can never know what people need or want (and it might change anyway) so to be on the safe side, the most respectful thing I can do is maintain a client’s privacy in every way I can – including with my co-workers.
