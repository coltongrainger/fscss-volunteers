How to react to the death of a community member?

From Trish Gregory:

> I have some sad news to share.  Yolanda Frederick who has called our entry way [to the FSCSS downtown office] home for the last year or two has passed away.  She was found unresponsive on the streets and was taken to St Peter's hospital where she died a short time later of natural causes.   

> I remember the first time that I met Yolanda.  It was early in the morning and she was in our entry way blocking the door and talking/yelling loudly at someone who wasn't there and was swinging her arms around.  I remember having to make the choice of do I go to the other door? Wait til she moves away?  I was a little nervous, but chose to say good morning and see what happened.  Yolanda immediately came back to reality, calmed herself and started apologetically cleaning up all of her belongings and moving out of the way.  We chatted for a bit about shelter options and she shared that she had a horrific shelter experience and would never go back. I remember feeling so grateful that I chose to engage with her instead of walking away.  

> I believe she chose to stay in our entry because our staff and our partners showed her compassion, kindness and respect.  The first people she saw each day, said hello and good morning rather than walking away.  She was offered food, coffee, and people who didn't judge her by her appearance or her housing status.  

> She was a very caring and thoughtful person who looked out for others and shared what little she had.  On one occasion we came to work to find that she had given up her entry way space to a family with two kids; placed herself along the outside perimeter and helping the family to line their sleeping spaces with suitcases to basically barricade the children on the inside near the door where they would feel safer.  

additional thoughts
- access to preventative healthcare for homeless persons
	- involves changing patient & provider dynamics
- creating space for "personal stories"
- pragmatic uses of space & resources
- putting donations into circulation
